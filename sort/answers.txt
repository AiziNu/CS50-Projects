sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Sort 1's performance consistently aligns with the characteristics of Bubble Sort, where it may perform relatively better on nearly sorted data. Bubble Sort is known for its simplicity and tendency to perform well when elements are nearly in order.

sort2 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Sort 2 consistently outperforms the other programs across all scenarios, indicating that it likely employs a more efficient algorithm. Given the performance characteristics and efficiency, Program 2 is likely using Quick Sort, which is known for its high performance and efficiency in most cases.

sort3 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Sort 3 shows varying performance across different scenarios, performing relatively better on reversed data compared to other scenarios. This behavior suggests that it might be using an algorithm optimized for reverse-ordered data, such as Merge Sort, which is known to perform well in such cases.
